# ez2_gmod_soldierhands
Garry's Mod soldier hand replacement for Entropy : Zero 2.

Note: hands_rig_nosml should have the same mesh as hands_rig, (translated down 57u) but mapped to the different bones.

Clone this repo, and edit hands_rig and hands_rig_nosml if you want to create your own hands mods.
